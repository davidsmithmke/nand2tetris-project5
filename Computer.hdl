/**
 * The HACK computer, including CPU, ROM and RAM.
 * When reset is 0, the program stored in the computer's ROM executes.
 * When reset is 1, the execution of the program restarts. 
 * Thus, to start a program's execution, reset must be pushed "up" (1)
 * and "down" (0). From this point onward the user is at the mercy of 
 * the software. In particular, depending on the program's code, the 
 * screen may show some output and the user may be able to interact 
 * with the computer via the keyboard.
